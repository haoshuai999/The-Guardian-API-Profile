#The Guardian API process log

1. Search for "cool API" on Google and find [a list of API](https://medium.com/@vicbergquist/18-fun-apis-for-your-next-project-8008841c7be9) on Medium. Check the API about Mars and beer and decide to look for more options.
2. Search for "public API list" on Google and find [a GitHub page](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#sports--fitness). Select The Guardian's API, because it is strongly related to journalism.
3. Register for a developer key on [The Guardian's open platform](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/).
4. Receive an email sent by The Guardian, get the API key and a link to the [API documentation](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/).
5. Find [the API explorer](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/explore/) in the documentation, and start to test "get" requests on that platform instead of sending real requests.
6. Read all the documentation carefully, test out three available endpoints and some parameters on API explorer. 
7. Create one table to explain selected query parameters.
8. Come up with queries that might be useful to readers and test them.
9. Write the code in Python to send "get" requests to The Guardian's API. Modify the code to create three queries.
10. Choose JSON as the format of output and create another table to explain important fields in the JSON files.
11. Organize the API profile and attach code blocks to it.
